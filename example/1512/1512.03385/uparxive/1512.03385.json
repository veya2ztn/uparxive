  "abstract": "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers\u20148$\\times$ deeper than VGG nets (See [Ref.[0] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions[[[Notice: http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/ and http://mscoco.org/dataset/#detections-challenge2015 .]]] , where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

          "Deep convolutional neural networks (See [Ref.[1,2] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) have led to a series of breakthroughs for image classification [Ref.[2,3,4] of ArXiv.1512.03385] . Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high-level features (See [Ref.[3] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) and classifiers in an end-to-end multi-layer fashion, and the \u201clevels\u201d of features can be enriched by the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence (See [Ref.[0,5] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) reveals that network depth is of crucial importance, and the leading results (See [Ref.[0,5,6,7] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) on the challenging ImageNet dataset (See [Ref.[8] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) all exploit \u201cvery deep\u201d (See [Ref.[0] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) models, with a depth of sixteen (See [Ref.[0] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) to thirty (See [Ref.[7] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) . Many other nontrivial visual recognition tasks (See [Ref.[9,10,11,12,13] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) have also greatly benefited from very deep models."
        ],
        [
          "Driven by the significance of depth, a question arises: Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers? An obstacle to answering this question was the notorious problem of vanishing/exploding gradients (See [Ref.[14,15] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) , which hamper convergence from the beginning. This problem, however, has been largely addressed by normalized initialization [Ref.[16,15,17,6] of ArXiv.1512.03385] and intermediate normalization layers (See [Ref.[7] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) , which enable networks with tens of layers to start converging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation [Ref.[1] of ArXiv.1512.03385] ."

        [
          "When deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting , and adding more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training error , as reported in [Ref.[18,19] of ArXiv.1512.03385] and thoroughly verified by our experiments. [Figure.0 of ArXiv.1512.03385] shows a typical example."
        ],
        [
          "The degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that not all systems are similarly easy to optimize. Let us consider a shallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds more layers onto it. There exists a solution by construction to the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping, and the other layers are copied from the learned shallower model. The existence of this constructed solution indicates that a deeper model should produce no higher training error than its shallower counterpart. But experiments show that our current solvers on hand are unable to find solutions that are comparably good or better than the constructed solution (or unable to do so in feasible time)."
        ],
        [
          "In this paper, we address the degradation problem by introducing a deep residual learning framework. Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as $\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})$, we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}):=\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})-\\mathbf{x}$. The original mapping is recast into $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x})+\\mathbf{x}$. We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers."

Shortcut connections (See [Ref.[20,21,22] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) are those skipping one or more layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply perform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the outputs of the stacked layers [Figure.1 of ArXiv.1512.03385] . Identity shortcut connections add neither extra parameter nor computational complexity. The entire network can still be trained end-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be easily implemented using common libraries (e.g ., Caffe (See [Ref.[23] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) ) without modifying the solvers."

Our ensemble has **3.57%** top-5 error on the ImageNet test set, and won the 1st place in the ILSVRC 2015 classification competition . The extremely deep representations also have excellent generalization performance on other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the 1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions. This strong evidence shows that the residual learning principle is generic, and we expect that it is applicable in other vision and non-vision problems."

An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis preconditioning (See [Ref.[31,32] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) , which relies on variables that represent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown (See [Ref.[30,31,32] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) that these solvers converge much faster than standard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the solutions. These methods suggest that a good reformulation or preconditioning can simplify the optimization."

An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output (See [Ref.[21,22] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) . In (See [Ref.[5,33] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) , a few intermediate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classifiers for addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers of (See [Ref.[34,35,36,37] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) propose methods for centering layer responses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by shortcut connections. In (See [Ref.[5] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) , an \u201cinception\u201d layer is composed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches."

These gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in contrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free. When a gated shortcut is \u201cclosed\u201d (approaching zero), the layers in highway networks represent non-residual functions. On the contrary, our formulation always learns residual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed, and all information is always passed through, with additional residual functions to be learned. In addition, highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth (e.g ., over 100 layers)."

If one hypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate complicated functions[[[Notice: (See [Ref.[40] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) .]]] , then it is equivalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approximate the residual functions, i.e ., $\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})-\\mathbf{x}$ (assuming that the input and output are of the same dimensions). So rather than expect stacked layers to approximate $\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})$, we explicitly let these layers approximate a residual function $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}):=\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})-\\mathbf{x}$.

The degradation problem suggests that the solvers might have difficulties in approximating identity mappings by multiple nonlinear layers.

Following (See [Ref.[0] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) , we first perform \u201coracle\u201d testing using the ground truth class as the classification prediction. VGG\u2019s (See [Ref. [Ref.[0] of ArXiv.1512.03385] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) reports a center-crop error of 33.1% [Table.10 of ArXiv.1512.03385] using ground truth classes. Under the same setting, our RPN method using ResNet-101 net significantly reduces the center-crop error to 13.3%. This comparison demonstrates the excellent performance of our framework. With dense (fully convolutional) and multi-scale testing, our ResNet-101 has an error of 11.7% using ground truth classes. Using ResNet-101 for predicting classes (4.6% top-5 classification error, [Table.9 of ArXiv.1512.03385] ), the top-5 localization error is 14.4%."

          "The above results are only based on the proposal network (RPN) in Faster R-CNN (See [Ref.[12] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) . One may use the detection network (Fast R-CNN (See [Ref.[11] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) ) in Faster R-CNN to improve the results. But we notice that on this dataset, one image usually contains a single dominate object, and the proposal regions highly overlap with each other and thus have very similar RoI-pooled features. As a result, the image-centric training of Fast R-CNN (See [Ref.[11] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) generates samples of small variations, which may not be desired for stochastic training. Motivated by this, in our current experiment we use the original R-CNN (See [Ref.[9] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) that is RoI-centric, in place of Fast R-CNN."

          "Our R-CNN implementation is as follows. We apply the per-class RPN trained as above on the training images to predict bounding boxes for the ground truth class. These predicted boxes play a role of class-dependent proposals. For each training image, the highest scored 200 proposals are extracted as training samples to train an R-CNN classifier. The image region is cropped from a proposal, warped to 224$\\times$224 pixels, and fed into the classification network as in R-CNN (See [Ref.[9] of ArXiv.1512.03385]) . The outputs of this network consist of two sibling fc layers for cls and reg , also in a per-class form. This R-CNN network is fine-tuned on the training set using a mini-batch size of 256 in the RoI-centric fashion. For testing, the RPN generates the highest scored 200 proposals for each predicted class, and the R-CNN network is used to update these proposals\u2019 scores and box positions."

Using an ensemble of networks for both classification and localization, we achieve a top-5 localization error of 9.0% on the test set. This number significantly outperforms the ILSVRC 14 results ( [Table.3 of ArXiv.1512.03385] ), showing a 64% relative reduction of error.
